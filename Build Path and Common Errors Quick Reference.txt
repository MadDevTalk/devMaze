This document outlines how each tab of the build path for each project should look. If you still have errors after configuring this, it is not related to LibGDX. There are plenty of those errors too, so if you run into one, just ask in the DevTalk group chat on Facebook. If you wanna be awesome, add what the error was and what the fix is to this document once you figure it out.
